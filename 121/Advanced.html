The Virtual Server option gives Internet users access to services on
your LAN. This feature is useful for hosting online services such as
FTP, Web, or game servers. For each Virtual Server, you define a public
port on your router for redirection to an internal LAN IP Address and
LAN port. </p>

This is the uplink speed measured when the WAN interface was last
re-established. The value may be lower than that reported by your ISP
as it does not include all of the network protocol overheads associated
with your ISP's network. Typically, this figure will be between 87% and
91% of the stated uplink speed for xDSL connections and around 5 kbps
lower for cable network connections. </dd>

If Automatic Uplink Speed is disabled, this options allows you to set
the uplink speed manually. Uplink speed is the speed at which data can
be transferred from the router to your ISP. This is determined by your
ISP. ISPs often specify speed as a downlink/uplink pair; for example,
1.5Mbps/284kbps. For this example, you would enter "284". Alternatively
you can test your uplink speed with a service such as <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/">www.dslreports.com</a>.
Note however that sites such as DSL Reports, because they do not
consider as many network protocol overheads, will generally note speeds
slightly lower than the Measured Uplink Speed or the ISP rated speed. </dd>

By default, the router automatically determines whether the underlying
connection is an xDSL/Frame-relay network or some other connection type
(such as cable modem or Ethernet), and it displays the result as <span class="option">Detected

xDSL or Frame Relay Network</span>.
If you have an unusual network connection in which you are actually
connected via xDSL but for which you configure either "Static" or
"DHCP" in the WAN settings, setting this option to <span class="option">
xDSL or Other Frame Relay Network</span>
ensures that the router will recognize that it needs to shape traffic
slightly differently in order to give the best performance. Choosing <span class="option">xDSL or Other Frame Relay Network</span>
causes the measured uplink speed to be reported slightly lower than
before on such connections, but gives much better results. </dd>

The router provides a tight firewall by virtue of the way NAT works.
Unless you configure the router to the contrary, the NAT does not
respond to unsolicited incoming requests on any port, thereby making
your LAN invisible to Internet cyberattackers. However, some network
applications cannot run with a tight firewall. Those applications need
to selectively open ports in the firewall to function correctly. The
options on this page control several ways of opening the firewall to
address the needs of specific types of applications. See also <a href="Virtual_Server.html">

SPI ("stateful packet inspection" also known as "dynamic packet
filtering") helps to prevent cyberattacks by tracking more state per
session. It validates that the traffic passing through that session
conforms to the protocol. When the protocol is TCP, SPI checks that
packet sequence numbers are within the valid range for the session,
discarding those packets that do not have valid sequence numbers. <p>
Whether SPI is enabled or not, the router always tracks TCP connection
states and ensures that each TCP packet's flags are valid for the
current state. </p>

that some of these options can interact with other port restrictions.
Endpoint Independent Filtering takes priority over inbound filters or
schedules, so it is possible for an incoming session request related to
an outgoing session to enter through a port in spite of an active
inbound filter on that port. However, packets will be rejected as
expected when sent to blocked ports (whether blocked by schedule or by
inbound filter) for which there are no active sessions. Port and
Address Restricted Filtering ensures that inbound filters and schedules
work precisely, but prevents some level of connectivity, and therefore
might require the use of port triggers, virtual servers, or port
forwarding to open the ports needed by the application. Address
Restricted Filtering gives a compromise position, which avoids problems
when communicating with certain other types of NAT router (symmetric
NATs in particular) but leaves inbound filters and scheduled access
working as expected.</p>

Formerly, the terms "Full Cone", "Restricted Cone", "Port Restricted
Cone" and "Symmetric" were used to refer to different variations of
NATs. These terms are purposely not used here, because they do not
fully describe the behavior of this router's NAT. While not a perfect
mapping, the following loose correspondences between the "cone"
classification and the "endpoint filtering" modes can be drawn: if this
router is configured for endpoint independent filtering, it implements
full cone behavior; address restricted filtering implements restricted
cone behavior; and port and address restricted filtering implements
port restricted cone behavior. </p>

DMZ means "Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble working
from behind the router, you can expose one computer to the Internet and
run the application on that computer. </p>
                                                                                            <p>
When a LAN host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the destination
for all incoming packets that do not match some other incoming session
or rule. If any other ingress rule is in place, that will be used
instead of sending packets to the DMZ host; so, an active session,
virtual server, active port trigger, or port forwarding rule will take
priority over sending a packet to the DMZ host. (The DMZ policy
resembles a default port forwarding rule that forwards every port that
is not specifically sent anywhere else.) </p>
                                                                                            <p>
The router provides only limited firewall protection for the DMZ host.
The router does not forward a TCP packet that does not match an active
DMZ session, unless it is a connection establishment packet (SYN).
Except for this limited protection, the DMZ host is effectively
"outside the firewall". Anyone considering using a DMZ host should also
consider running a firewall on that DMZ host system to provide
additional protection. </p>
                                                                                            <p>
Packets received by the DMZ host have their IP addresses translated
from the WAN-side IP address of the router to the LAN-side IP address
of the DMZ host. However, port numbers are not translated; so
applications on the DMZ host can depend on specific port numbers. </p>
                                                                                            <p>
The DMZ capability is just one of several means for allowing incoming
requests that might appear unsolicited to the NAT. In general, the DMZ
host should be used only if there are no other alternatives, because it
is much more exposed to cyberattacks than any other system on the LAN.
Thought should be given to using other configurations instead: a
virtual server, a port forwarding rule, or a port trigger. Virtual
servers open one port for incoming sessions bound for a specific
application (and also allow port redirection and the use of ALGs ).
Port forwarding is rather like a selective DMZ, where incoming traffic
targeted at one or more ports is forwarded to a specific LAN host
(thereby not exposing as many ports as a DMZ host). Port triggering is
a special form of port forwarding, which is activated by outgoing
traffic, and for which ports are only forwarded while the trigger is
active. </p>
                                                                                            <p>
Few applications truly require the use of the DMZ host. Following are
examples of when a DMZ host might be required: </p>
                                                                                            <ul>

Here you can enable or disable ALGs. Some protocols and applications
require special handling of the IP payload to make them work with
network address translation (NAT). Each ALG provides special handling
for a specific protocol or application. A number of ALGs for common
applications are enabled by default. <dl>

Allows multiple machines on the LAN to connect to their corporate
networks using PPTP protocol. When the PPTP ALG is enabled, LAN
computers can establish PPTP VPN connections either with the same or
with different VPN servers. When the PPTP ALG is disabled, the router
allows VPN operation in a restricted way -- LAN computers are typically
able to establish VPN tunnels to different VPN Internet servers but not
to the same server. The advantage of disabling the PPTP ALG is to
increase VPN performance. Enabling the PPTP ALG also allows incoming
VPN connections to a LAN side VPN server (refer to <a href="Virtual_Server.html">Advanced → Virtual&nbsp;Server</a>).

Allows multiple VPN clients to connect to their corporate networks
using IPSec. Some VPN clients support traversal of IPSec through NAT.
This option may interfere with the operation of such VPN clients. If
you are having trouble connecting with your corporate network, try
disabling this option. <p>
Check with the system administrator of your corporate network whether
your VPN client supports NAT traversal. </p>

Note that L2TP VPN connections typically use IPSec to secure the
connection. To achieve multiple VPN pass-through in this case, the
IPSec ALG must be enabled. </p>

Allows devices and applications using VoIP (Voice over IP) to

When you use the Virtual Server, Port Forwarding, or Remote
Administration features to open specific ports to traffic from the
Internet, you could be increasing the exposure of your LAN to
cyberattacks from the Internet. In these cases, you can use Inbound
Filters to limit that exposure by specifying the IP addresses of
internet hosts that you trust to access your LAN through the ports that
you have opened. You might, for example, only allow access to a game
server on your home LAN from the computers of friends whom you have
invited to play the games on that server. </p>
                                                                                    <p>
Inbound Filters can be used for limiting access to a server on your
network to a system or group of systems. Filter rules can be used with
Virtual Server, Gaming, or Remote Administration features. Each filter
can be used for several functions; for example a "Game Clan" filter
might allow all of the members of a particular gaming group to play
several different games for which gaming entries have been created. At
the same time an "Admin" filter might only allows systems from your
office network to access the WAN admin pages and an FTP server you use
at home. If you add an IP address to a filter, the change is effected
in all of the places where the filter is used. </p>

Normally the wireless transmitter operates at 100% power. In some
circumstances, however, there might be a need to isolate specific
frequencies to a smaller area. By reducing the power of the radio, you
can prevent transmissions from reaching beyond your corporate/home
office or designated wireless area. </dd>

When an excessive number of wireless packet collisions are occurring,
wireless performance can be improved by using the RTS/CTS (Request to
Send/Clear to Send) handshake protocol. The wireless transmitter will
begin to send RTS frames (and wait for CTS) when data frame size in
bytes is greater than the RTS Threshold. This setting should remain at
its default value of 2346 bytes. </dd>

Wireless frames can be divided into smaller units (fragments) to
improve performance in the presence of RF interference and at the
limits of RF coverage. Fragmentation will occur when frame size in
bytes is greater than the Fragmentation Threshold. This setting should
remain at its default value of 2346 bytes. Setting the Fragmentation
value too low may result in poor performance. </dd>

A DTIM is a countdown informing clients of the next window for
listening to broadcast and multicast messages. When the wireless router
has buffered broadcast or multicast messages for associated clients, it
sends the next DTIM with a DTIM Interval value. Wireless clients detect
the beacons and awaken to receive the broadcast and multicast messages.
The default value is 1. Valid settings are between 1 and 255. </dd>

through manual configuration, prompt you to enter the PIN for the
device, or ask you to press the configuration button on the device. If
the device supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup and has a configuration

button on the device and then the on the router within 60 seconds. The
status LED on the router will flash three times if the device has been
successfully added to the network.</p>

are several ways to add a wireless device to your network. Access to
the wireless network is controlled by a “registrar”. A registrar only
allows devices onto the wireless network if you have entered the PIN,
or pressed a special Wi-Fi Protected Setup button on the device. The
router acts as a registrar for the network, although other devices may
act as a registrar as well.</p>

method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended to
provide the same level of privacy as a wired network. WEP is not as
secure as WPA encryption. To gain access to a WEP network, you must
know the key. The key is a string of characters that you create. When
using WEP, you must determine the level of encryption. The type of
encryption determines the key length. 128-bit encryption requires a
longer key than 64-bit encryption. Keys are defined by entering in a
string in HEX (hexadecimal - using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange - alphanumeric
characters) format. ASCII format is provided so you can enter a string
that is easier to remember. The ASCII string is converted to HEX for
use over the network. Four keys can be defined so that you can change
keys easily. A default key is selected for use on the network.</p>

WPA if the client only supports WPA. With the "WPA2 Only" option, the

The key is entered as a pass-phrase of up to 63 alphanumeric characters
in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) format at
both ends of the wireless connection. It cannot be shorter than eight
characters, although for proper security it needs to be of ample length
and should not be a commonly known phrase. This phrase is used to
generate session keys that are unique for each wireless client. </p>
